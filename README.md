**Dry Eye - Data Analysis**
**Introduction**
Dry Eye Disease (DED)
Definition: A condition where tears can't adequately lubricate the eyes, leading to inflammation and surface damage.
Causes:
Insufficient tear production
Poor-quality tears causing instability
Common Triggers:
Airplanes (dry cabin air)
Air-conditioned rooms
Wind exposure (e.g., biking)
Prolonged screen time (computer, phone)

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Data Quality & consistency check
Shape of Data: Dataset contains 20,000 rows and 26 attributes (20000, 26)
Missing Values: No missing values found in the dataset (0 missing)
Duplicates: No duplicate entries detected (0 duplicates)

Possible health outcomes
**Objective: To use machine learning and predictive models to forecast whether a patient is likely to develop Dry Eye Disease.**

**Key Benefits of Prediction:**
1. Early detection
2. Tailored treatments
3. Improved quality of life for patients
4. Reduced healthcare costs
